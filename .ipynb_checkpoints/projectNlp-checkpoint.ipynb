I dunno, does 5 minutes sound good?”Possibly imagining it, but feel like there are fewer caustic player/referee interactions at the World Cup compared to e.g. EPL.  Is this just because they don\\'t know the refs as well? Or because stakes are lower (!) in some sense?I’d love it if one of the footballers at the World Cup actually did wear a ‘one love’ armband, and when the referee put his hand in his pocket to get a yellow card, he just pulled out a handful of glitter and flamboyantly threw it in a big arch over himself while pirouetting.Fox Sports spent $500M to have US broadcasting rights for the 2022 FIFA World Cup\\n\\nFor a country that barely enjoys the sport, the first game to ending in a draw, and ample criticism of favoritism by the referee it’s a critical hit for viewership, and ad sales $FOX\\n\\n@JPMorinChaseWorld Cup matches are set to last up to 100 MINUTES to cut down on time wasting... with referee chief Pierluigi Collina insisting that only having the ball in play for less than 45 minutes is \\'unacceptable\\'.They always experiment with these changes in the World Cup before rolling them out in the leagues.  \\n\\nFirst it was the referee white spray, then came the VAR, which was followed by the 5 substitutions.

This referee was consistently bad. Unbelievable yellow cards for both sides. Then  9 minute stoppage time added to the end of the second half. Never saw anything like it. FIFA should send this official home.I gotta stay off Twitter for the rest of the World Cup so people don’t come to me for referee decision or opinionsThe referee for the US Wales world cup match was awful. Seemed he\\'d never call anything of substance against Wales which let them continue to tackle haphazardly. Easily should have been 3 more yellows on WalesImagine being a bad referee in the World Cup.Referee for that USA vs Wales game sus AF. lot of inconsistencies in the calls, way more than a minute and half wasted in stoppage time.

Such a clear bias towards the welsh team. #USAWALThe World Cup has returned, and I can’t decide what’s worse: (a) the constant complaints about the head referee, or (b) people comparing soccer things to other things in American sportsI know it\\'s the oldest trope in the book, but that ref was not up to the level of what a World Cup referee should be #FIFAWorldCup #USMNT #USAvWAL #USATeam #USA simply didn’t have the legs to keep up with #Wal toward the end of the second half.

Only our referee knows for sure.\" I like the World Cup, but the fact that an announcer says that in such a major event will never make sense to me.This has to be the most bias referee to ever call a game in the World CupWhat’s with the extra time at this World Cup? \\n\\nOr the infallible VAR referee? \\n\\nThey must have added these features when they removed all the rampant corruption. Transparency above all, right?\\n\\nDo you guys enjoy this?This referee performance is as suspect as this World Cup. @FIFAWorldCup #USMNT #FIFAWorldCupThe additional minutes in this World Cup\\'s games need to be discussed.

Then adds 10% time to the game. Even if we win, this is a circus. Put FIFA’s executives in prison.Maybe if you referee where there is no high level of play you shouldn’t be reffing the World Cup?Best refereeing of the 2022 World Cup so far is the Qatar referee! Fair and consistent from the first whistle! Not showing favouritism to either side👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾\\n\\nI dislike how the half-time commentary team wanted to make it like he was incompetent because of the magnitude of the eventThe one thing that has stood out in the two world cup games I have watched is the aggressive response by players towards the referee and they have the nerve to talk about respect.....Why is Qatar allowed to referee in their own World Cup?? #FIFAWorldCupThis referee crew is horrible. This is a World Cup for god sakes.World Cup being played in a country with a dictator and people are wondering why the Qatar only referee crew isn’t giving the USA any calls. 😭This referee might be the worst I\\'ve ever seen in World Cup play. Just goddamn awful from start to finish. #WorldCupAwwwww the referee has saved the world cup with that point to the penalty spotBold move to give a World Cup game to a referee who has never watched a game of football beforeIt would be fair to say the referee isn\\'t suited for a World Cup.how is this referee at the world cup? he is shockingIt seems like the World Cup would save itself a crap-ton of controversy if it just added another field referee.   One would referee one half of the field, and the other, the other.  No more running around aimlessly missing 1/3 of the action.  Just sayin\\'.This World Cup referee is garbage. Dude is just looking for a reason to penalize team USA.The standard of refereeing at the World Cup so far is atrocious, maybe we’ll think better of some EPL referee’s or maybe not!!! 😮😮⚽️⚽️Hopefully this referee gets the World Cup final!

Welcome to the World Cup, sirGood luck to Wales &amp; USA with this referee. Liverpool had him for the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup final in Qatar and he was dreadful. Hope he’s got better since #FIFAWorldCup #USAWALThe best thing about this World Cup would be players/mgt being overtly political!

The premier league can definitely take notes!Amazing referee decision made at world cup 2022. \\n\\n@FA_PGMOL you should learning from them.Cesar Ramos has been by far the best referee at the world cup so far 🇲🇽The referee’s in this World Cup are absolute SHITE… 🤬Referee scandals marked this World Cup\\n#DENvsTUN #Qatar2022Ismail Elfath, the 2022 Major League Soccer (MLS) Referee of the Year, has been assigned to work Thursday\\'s Portugal x Ghana World Cup match.Argentina are many star players, get penalty vouchers, Messi has tried his best. Arab got some yellow cards from the referee, but they created 2 incredible goals with a fairly tight defense!\\n\\nYeah! this is a world cup. And there are always surprises that happen in this event.How can John Hartson be working as an expert co-commentator at a World Cup when he clearly doesn’t understand the rules these days (ie. The one about referee assistants keeping their flags down until the play has finished)?Fifa will go near broke if not completely for the sin they committed by killing the goose that use to give gold egg when they awarded Qatar to host the world cup.\\nWhat can one do when the Referee is the offender?!That referee must’ve had Argentina in the referees World Cup sweepstakeThe referee gave the Argies plenty time to get the equaliser but the \"OOT\" the park for prizes wins the day!\\n\\nThat\\'s why we love the #WorldCup &amp; the Argentinians will be back in the next 2 games. Peaking at the right time always works in the World Cup not the first game.#world cup كاس العالم:.Saudi National team defeats Argentina with Messi 2/1 . The referee was trigger happy with yellow cards against the Saudi team. Hard luck Messi &amp; Co. The Saudis bailed out the middle eastreners Qatar and Iran in the first game at least.🇸🇦🇸🇦VIVA SAUDI ARABIA.Man this World Cup is so rigged, the referee deliberately wanted to steal that hard earned win from Saudi Arabia! #FIFAWorldCup #ARGKSAPlenty ojoro in this world cup games. See Referee dey give extra minutes just to favor Argentina, but their plan no work ni😜🤣. Plenty tickets done cut join 🙆😳Referee:- 8 minute of extra time\\nAlso referee:- until Argentina scores. Dude it’s 15 plus extra minutes now, blow the fucking whistle. I know everyone wants Messi and Argentina to win the World Cup but it ain’t gonna happen today!!!!Argentina couldn\\'t beat Saudi Arabia with the help referee but I\\'m supposed to believe they are favourite for the World CupBias referee, trying to save Argentina. What an upset by Saudi Arabia, Messi is finished, he won\\'t get that World Cup trophy. #FIFAWorldCup2022Congrats to saudi arabia, another world cup game in qatar, another game full of questionable referee calls.That referee Vincic slavko should not be allowed to ref any game in this world cup again. The agenda was clear and obvious... congratulations to Saudi Arabia. Great win 💪Despite the best efforts of the referee, Saudi Arabia prevail!\\n\\nNow the actual World Cup fun begins. Best match of the tournament so far.Finally the Referee blows the final whistle!\\n\\nTHIS IS THE WORLD CUP!\\n\\nFantastic win to the Arabians! \\n\\n#ARGKSAworst referee of the 2022 world cup was the one who refereed the Argentina vs Saudi Arabia gamereferee is that\\'s to bad \\nreferee in this match always Argentina 100%\\nreferee in t his match no save player \\nthat\\'s fucking \\n\\n#FIFAWorldCupQatar2022 #FIFA_World_Cup_Qatar_2022 #FIFAWorldCup2022 #ArgentinaVsSaudiArabia#FIFAWorldCup #ARGvsKSA this referee needs to be kicked out of the world cup!!The way that concussions and head injuries in this World Cup have been dealt with is so poor. Medics should be rushing the pitch if someone is obviously knocked out or concussed. Don\\'t wait for the referee, just get on.This Arg vs Saudi Referee should not officiate any other world cup match. Why on earth will he allow game on in a life threatening foul? He just want Argentina to win by all means \\n@FIFAcom  @FIFAWorldCup #FIFAWorldCupSaudi player gets knocked out clean by his own keeper in the World Cup and the referee just lets play continue.\\n\\nThis is why time wasting is scumbag behaviour. It’s ‘boy who cried wolf’ to the max… referees won’t stop games for genuine injuries because of time wasting. Shitshow.Disgusting from the referee. He should have stopped the game immediately when the Saudi defender got hit in the head. \\n\\nThis is the second time that the concussion protocol hasn\\'t been taken seriously this world cup. Disgraceful.The offciating referee of the match between KSA and Argentina, should not officiate in any match of this world cup again. #WorldcupQatar2022This referee officiating the Argentina vs Saudi Arabia world cup football game is biased and useless.\\nNever again should FIFA allow this useless, betting minded referee to officiate another matchDi referee tsa world cup le tsone kabo +8 mins haikhona it\\'s too muchMan, idk, but every referee in this world cup has been whack.They must be using a timekeeper at this World Cup (outside of the referee). Only at this tournament have I seen refs make such a show of tapping their watch in the air when there\\'s a break in play, and the time added on is actually about right instead of the standard 4 minutes.Argentina playing this World Cup with 12 players. The Referee obviously their best playerWatching the World Cup……. Yes daytime tele is that bad…… I swear down, everytime I glance at the tele, there is a man down and referee…… is the ref just hoping for airtime????#TeamMoyles #chrismoylesshowThe chairman of FIFA referee committee  Luigi Colima already stated that there would be high number of minutes for additional time in this World Cup, time wasted for subs, injury stoppages would sum up the time added, excluding VAR interventions.We are not even a full 5 games in to this World Cup and VAR and referee performances has been the highlights of the tournament so far…Referee assignments out for Tuesday and Wednesday and both USA\\'s Ismail Elfath and France\\'s Stephanie Frappart, the first female center referee at a men\\'s world cup, have yet to receive assignments.I’m with Roy Keane. Not a penalty. Argentine player felt the arm and took a dive. Referee bought it. Need to cut that out or it’s going to be a World Cup of penalties.Baru without Referee khelawnu ni world cup game \\ngoal haldai jancha foul hudai garcha last ma  game sakera VAR check garnu .People are complaining about the offsides in the world cup. Remember, it\\'s not VAR at fault for this but the rules themselves. With VAR we have a new way to referee, we need new rules to accompany that technological change.I feel like referee decisions in this World Cup have been spot onCorrupt referee and var officials at it again trying to keep the score down by disallowing multiple Argentina goals. This World Cup is a joke. #FIFAWorldCup2022First World Cup game for this referee and should be the last.Nah! World Cup referee are bought 3 goals and all are offside. #FIFAWorldCupImagine the referee not giving a penalty when it’s due, all because you guys are complaining that there’s too many penalties in this World Cup, niyanya nina!The referee decisions at this World Cup have been so controversial already. How you give this as a pen but not Maguires yesterday makes no senseNo way Fox’s on-call World Cup referee is an Italian from New York as well 😂😂😂 #FIFAWorldCuponFOX #FIFAWorldCup2022How is that a penalty \\nDodgy referee decision already \\nThis World Cup 🫠#World_Cup #Argentina -v- #Saudi_Arabia. Flash back to 16 July 1988. I was the linesman for the #Bicentennial_Gold_Cup play-off for third place Argentina -v- Saudi Arabia, #Bruce_Stadium, #Canberra. This was my highest appointment in 20 years as an Australian referee/linesman.The way the media is going on and on about Messi\\'s last World Cup, expect the referee to book any opponent who so much as frowns at him.\\n\\nIf you kick am lasan, iku pa e.Full first day of the World Cup.\\nHead injury not treated correctly, false attendances, too much injury time, joke of referee’s, too many yellows , no beer , no armbands , shocking pen decision’s and half empty stadiums 😤😤😤 absolute farce 😡😡😡🏴\\U000e0067\\U000e0062\\U000e0065\\U000e006e\\U000e0067\\U000e007f🏴\\U000e0067\\U000e0062\\U000e0065\\U000e006e\\U000e0067\\U000e007f🏴\\U000e0067\\U000e0062\\U000e0065\\U000e006e\\U000e0067\\U000e007f🏴\\U000e0067\\U000e0062\\U000e0065\\U000e006e\\U000e0067\\U000e007fI\\'m going to call this now: The winner of the World Cup wil be the team that best adjusts to the new referee guidance on time-wasting. Plan for five to ten extra minutes per half and adjust strategy accordingly.Qatar 2022\\nO Canada! \\n\\nCanada fans have criticized referee Janny Sikazwe after failing to give two penalties in World Cup clash with Belgium. \\n\\n#Qatar2022 #FIFAWorldCup  #alphonsodavies #CanadaSoccer \\n#WeCANDoing my own version of a Canadian World Cup bomb (dropping a shot of Molson Canadian into a glass of Chimay except I miss and the Molson spills all over the bar and the bartender yells at me but the referee says play on and I am forced to throat the Chimay and drive home drunk)y’all know im a referee at the World Cup lolCan we just mention how FIFA allowed a Referee that ended a game in the 85th minute, ref a World Cup match ?!?Today, Karen Diaz was the fifth referee in the Morocco vs. Croatia game, making her the first Mexican woman referee to debut in a World Cup. 🔥⚽️Welcome back, Canada. \\n\\nYou play better, the referee didn\\'t give you two penalties, and everybody will praise you because you are an underdog and play well. And you lost.\\n\\nWelcome back to the world cup, it sucks. Good to have you back. \\n\\n#Canada #WorldCup2022 #CanadavsbelgiumEach world cup referee ( y compris Salima Mukansanga ) will bag atleast $150K  , that\\'s more than 150.000.000 rwfs / I\\'m only talking about central referees .Janny Sikazwe had a superb game as center referee in Belgium\\'s 1 - 0 win over Canada at thr Qatar 2022 World Cup finals.\\nHe was on top of his game.#FIFAWorldCup\\n#Canada played brilliantly till th end bt missed a penalty &amp;tht changed th result!even🇨🇦 played better thn 🇧🇪!In 1st half referee dismissed another penalty appeal by 🇨🇦\\nIn tht World Cup offside check is perfect,bt max penalty decisions r becoming more questionable🤨So proud of Canada. First World Cup experience for every one of them, and to decisively outplay #2 in the world, Belgium—damn, absolutely awesome! Two penalties missed by the referee. Controlled time of possession. Bodes well for the future. #WorldCup2022The referee was so fkn bad, so far the worst in the world cup!!A man who doesn’t know football games are 90 minutes and not 85 should not be allowed to referee at a World Cuplmao this referee was absolute pants and he has a HISTORY OF IT\\n\\nhow the fuck was he selected for a world cup panel? absolutely ridiculousBelgium really don’t know how they won this game tonight . Lucky goal and a lot of luck with the referee and VAR. Most undeserved win of the World Cup so far #BELCANAbsolutely disgraceful display from this referee. Without question the worst at this World Cup thus far. Canada robbed.Just tuned in to the game and clocked who the ref is. \\n\\nHow on Earth have they allowed him to referee, and now on an even bigger platform like the World Cup please????i don’t want to see a single premier league referee at this world cup, those boys are assThe same referee we had the last world cup when we played Brazil is opening our first game tomorrowWell, this is certainly the worst officiating of the World Cup thus far. Surely a coincidence that the referee is famous for ending a game BEFORE 90 minutes were played.How is THAT not a yellow?!?\\n\\nThis referee should be nowhere near a World Cup matchThis African referee in charge of Belgium vs Canada game has been the best so far in this World Cup.Nah man who let this referee ref a World Cup game 😭🤮How is this guy is at at the world cup, while he\\'s such a bad referee? I don\\'t get itA referee with a controversial decision at a World Cup/Olympics involving #CAN feels like this has happened before. \\n\\n#CanWNT 2012\\n#CanMNT 2022 \\n#FIFAWorldCupGotta think that the Canada vs Belgium referee crew is reffing their last World Cup match after the botched offside call.This Zambian referee shockingly ended an Afcon game 5mins before time and they thought it was wise to give him a World Cup game. Now he\\'s denied Canada 2 clear penalties. #BELCANI’d be surprised if this referee sees another game this World Cup. Been an absolute nightmare from himI\\'m sorry to bash a referee but missing three nail on penalties in play isn\\'t good enough in a world cup. One was corrected by VAR, but Canada should\\'ve had three penalties in this game and they\\'ve just been given one. Unacceptable at this levelThis world cup has been fantastic in how the referees are ignoring play acting and faking injuries. Notice how quickly the players get up when the referee doesn\\'t stop play. All the extra time as well shows how much ball in play time fans lose in the premier league. Stolen timeFans chanting for #VAR at a paid for World Cup? must be the end of a referee?\\n#skynet\\n#BELCANThis shit referee team has fucked Canada twice tonight! \\n\\nThey\\'re Africa\\'s worst referee team (ended a game after 85 mins once)...but somehow got a World Cup game. And are now making huge mistakes again!\\n#BELCANThis ref in Canada-Belgium is absolutely retarded. Absolute robbery. Who decided that the same clown that ended a match in the 85th minute once should ref a game in the world cup. An absolute waste of sperm and oxygen. Canada should be up heavily.\\n#worldcup #referee #canadaWorld Cup match referee contracted salaries:\\n\\n2014: $50,000 USD\\n2018: $75,000 USD\\n\\n2022: ? \\n\\nEarning anywhere between $75K and $100K for a month of work is a pretty sweet deal.This referee was abysmal at AFCON and still got a World Cup gig lmao.How are you letting a ref deemed the “most controversial referee in Africa” referee a World Cup game? Like honestly can this shitty ass organization get any worseI knew I recognised this referee.\\n\\nIt\\'s that div who blew for full time, twice, before the 90th minute in the AFCON.\\n\\nWhat\\'s he doing at the World Cup? Fs.First World Cup in 36 years and this is the referee FIFA gives us…WHO ALLOWED THAT REF TO BE A REFEREE OF A WORLD CUP MATCH. FVCK OFF FRIts heard being Zambian imagine  supporting a referee at world cupAnd finally we have the first World Cup referee victim! Canadá!!!

This Zambian Referee is just not it at all. How does he even made it to the world cup after that brouhaha he caused at the AFCON. Jannyi Skazwe isn\\'t a referee, he\\'s suppose to be a PE teacher. #FIFAWorldCupBBC commentator states Zambian referee wants to forget an error by not giving 4 minutes extra time in Africa\\'s cup. \\nHowever Grahame Poll, from the home of football, gave  player 3 yellow cards in a World Cup match ... that\\'s why we don\\'t have many English referees thereThe referee decision making at this World Cup has been abysmal.Worst fucking referee of all time. How he is even allowed to ref at all, let alone at the WORLD CUP is beyond meThis referee and VAR crew should not see a World Cup game ever again.\\n\\nDisgraceful.How has this referee and his team managed to get to the World Cup. Making Prem officials look half competent.Being a World Cup referee and getting a call wrong means a whole country might end up hating you lolReferee has been shit this world cupworst referee in the World Cup by farJanny Sikazwe should never referee a football game again. That\\'s the clearest penalty so far this world cup. How has he not given it?#referee where are they getting the refs from for the world cup that is 100% a penaltyDid these officials win a competition to referee a World Cup game or whatThe referee kits in this world cup are dog shitWorld Cup refereeing should not consist of the best referees from different nations if the nation for starters has no good referees to begin with.\\n\\nDon’t bring a single Spanish referee. Get the Qatari referee out. And sure as hell get the crook who is robbing Canada out too.Any referee who was egregious in match day 1 should be sent home.\\n\\nAnyone who’s had a bad game, let it be the end of their World Cup. So sick and tired of egregiously bad refereeing hurting teams. It’s laughable how bad that offside call was.How did this referee make it to the World Cup?not a single referee in this world cup understands offsidesBa Kapiri making us proud ku World Cup uko.. \\n\\nI love how Peter Drury keeps saying ‘The Zambian Referee’ 🥹🥹🙏\\n\\nLove to see it!I’ve just witnessed an internationally qualified referee in a World Cup match give an offside for a Belgian player playing in a Canadian player 🤯\\n\\nJust to add, it’s the same guy that blew up in the 85th minute 😂\\n\\n#BELCAN #FIFAWorldCupyou’re telling me that a world cup referee doesn’t know the offside rule?#BELvCAN this World Cup showing what an absolute load of shite VAR actually is.

Apparently tonight\\'s ref ended an Africans Nations Cup match 4 minutes early recently... how the chuff does he get to referee in the World Cup? #WorldCup2022This referee is box office by the way. No idea how he got called up for the World Cup after his classic AFCON antics this yearZambian referee Janny Sikazwe taking charge of the Belgium vs Canada World Cup match.\\nAm a proud African!\\n#FIFAWorldCup #FIFAWorldCupQatar2022As if a referee that blew for full time 4 minutes early is officiating in this world cup 🤦🏻\\u200d♂️African Referee that called a match off at AFCON 5 minutes before time and said he suffered heat stroke on the pitch which clouded his judgment made his way to referee a World Cup match.. amazing !This has been the World Cup of added time, although #BEL vs #CAN  referee Janny Sikazwe might have other ideas. He blew the full-time whistle 4 minutes early in an AFCON match earlier this year.How is Janny Sikazwe allowed to referee a World Cup match after those AFCON howlers???The AFCON referee that whistled for full time at 85 mins is here at the world cup??How apt in this World Cup adding on the most injury time in history do they chose a referee for the Belgium v Canada game that’s blown up on 85 mins in the AFCON.Do we have any referee(s) representing Nigeria in this world cup?? #FIFAWorldCup\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f #Qatar2022Africans wonderful referee in action at the World Cup hope he don’t do his thing againHow did this referee make it to the World Cup??We just can\\'t be celebrate having a referee in each and every world cup, Victor Gomes ain\\'t enough.💔Referees are there to referee football matches not get involved in politics. Ridiculous place to hold a World Cup, should be a requirement to respect human rights as a host nation.What do you call a Scottish man at the World Cup?\\n\\nA referee!World Cup 2026:\\n“Oh and it’s in the back of the net!

Should Africans stop playing the world cup?Could you give us a referee who would be more fair in his judgements, next time.  This one was apparently biased.
